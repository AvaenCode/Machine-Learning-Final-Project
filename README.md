# Bitcoin Price Prediction & Kickstarter Project Success Prediction (R-Studio)

A machine learning project done in R-Studio. In this project I perform a total of 6 prediction algorithms, 3 of which are regression algorithms while the other 3 are classification algorithms. The first half of the project tries to create models that can help predict the price of Bitcoin using the following:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees (w/ Random Forests)
- kNN Regression

As you can see from the results, my 3 models were prone to overfitting but the purpose of this project was NOT to create good models but rather compare the performance of each algorithm. In addition, anything that can be learned from the data is a bonus.

The 2nd half of the project covers the classification portion where I ran the 3 following classification algorithms to see if I can predict the category of the project based on it's performance statistics:

- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Trees (w/ Random Forests)

As mentioned above, the goal of this project was to assess the performance of these algorithms, not create a highly accurate model.
